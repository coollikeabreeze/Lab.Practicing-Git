This is my repo for learning git.
So far, we've learned the command line commands:
    - git init
    - git add
    - git commit
    - git push
We've also learned how to do the following via the command line: 
    - create a directory on the local machine ('mkdir')
    - add files to the directory ('touch' command)
    - push an existing local repository to a new GitHub repository
